# Heart Disease Prediction
This is a short machine learning project that utilizes the "Heart Failure Prediction Dataset" from Kaggle. 
The data is manipulated to remove unnecessary information that may improve the overall outcome.
Each different manipulation is tested to see which has the best outcome\
\
List of Machine Learning Algorithms:
1) Gradient Boost
2) ADA Boost
3) XG Boost
4) Random Forest Classifier
5) KNN Classifier
6) SVC
7) Logistic Regression
8) Decision Tree Classifier
